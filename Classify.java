// Example code on how to send a subset of features to a classifier
// and it includes first needing to create an aarf file with
// these specific features and then activating the classifier
// by calling the MyWekaUtils class

// This example is for a csv file with six features labeled 0 thru 5
// You will have 12 features

// This example is choosing three of the features (0, 2 and 5) upon which to
// train the classifier - you will be using increasing sets of features
// incrementally and finding the best - see the tutorial

// You will also not be printing the answers but collecting them and choosing
// the best features

public class Classify {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        try {
            // first get the full features file
            String[][] csvData = MyWekaUtils.readCSV("features4sw.csv");

            //int[] features = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // all the features
            int[] features = {0, 2, 5}; // use mean_x, mean_y, std_z

            String arffData = MyWekaUtils.csvToArff(csvData, features);

            //classifier options-> 1 = Decision Tree, 2 = RandomForest, 3 = SVM
            double accuracy = MyWekaUtils.classify(arffData, 1);
            System.out.println(accuracy);
